#rename columns
df = df.rename(columns={"target_text":"completion", "source_text":"prompt"})
df

df.to_json('temp_big.json', orient='records', lines=True)

Then in terminal do :
         
		  
	  openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data  -f temp_big.json
	  
	  - the sufix separator to all prompts is `\n\n###\n\n`
	  -Add a whitespace character to the beginning of the completion
	  -After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string `\n\n###\n\n` for the model to start generating completions, 
	                  rather than continuing with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=["}"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
      -Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 6.44 hours to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`.
      -Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
	   
	   
	   
	   
	  * and the  file will be  renamed
